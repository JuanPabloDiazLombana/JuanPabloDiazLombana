# Hello there
I am Juan Pablo Diaz Lombana
I am currenly a student of **Universidad del Valle** in Colombia.
I love giving instruction to a computer and to see those instructions reflected on the hardware.
All my programming skills come mainly from self teaching by reading forums and watching videos.
I can understand and speak Spanish, English and Japanese, although my speaking skills are a bit low.
## What I program on
- Python 3
- Java
- A little of C++ (I am still learning)
- HTML
- PHP
